# covid-19-Android-Application
The sudden emergence of Coronavirus infections (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan, China, and was declared a "pandemic" on March 11, 2020, needed a massive global reaction to monitor and contain COVID-19's transmission, and effect. Mobile technology can also be used to help restrict the transmission of COVID-19 in several ways, as well as to promote knowledge translation. Mobile applications are convenient, acceptable, and easy to implement, and they can help with social distancing.
This project is about building an Android application that will have features such as a dashboard that consists of data related to COVID-19 (number of cases, number of deaths, number of recoveries, etc.) both globally and country-wise; thereafter, it will also have a segment with the total number of people vaccinated, country-wise. Then, a segment with helpline numbers will be state-wise (only for India). The application will also consist of segments, that will introduce people to symptoms of COVID-19 and also spread awareness regarding it. The final segment will help people find the nearest vaccination centers to them; just by entering their pin code and selecting the date, they will get information about the centers which will include data such as the name of the center, name of the vaccine, location, timing, age group, number of vaccines available and whether the vaccine is free of cost or charged.
